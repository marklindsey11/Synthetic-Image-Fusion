This code is a theoretical classification methodology to enable detection with predicted signatures. It uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for predicting signatures. 

The code starts by creating a dataset with  four  points  and  their  corresponding  labels.  The  KNN  is then  trained  on  this  dataset  and  used  to  predict  the  signatures. Finally, the accuracy of the model is evaluated. 

The output of this code is the predicted signatures and the accuracy of the model. 

This code can be used to detect patterns in data and make predictions about future data points. It can also be used to classify data points into different categories. 

Instructions for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Algorithm: 

1. Define the data. This should include the X values (the data points) and the y values (the labels for the data points). 

2. Train the KNN model. This should include fitting the model to the data.

3. Predict the signatures. This should include using the model to predict the signatures from the X values.

4. Evaluate the model. This should include using the model to measure the accuracy of the predictions. 

5. Output the predicted signatures and the accuracy of the model.

Thank you for using the Mark Lindsey K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Algorithm!
