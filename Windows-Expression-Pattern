This script will search for the patterns `exec`, `eval`, `system`, and `popen` within the `C:\Windows` directory and all of its subdirectories. If any of these patterns are found in a file, the script will print a message indicating that possible malicious code has been found.

Note that this script is just a starting point, and you may want to modify it to fit your specific needs. For example, you may want to add additional patterns to search for, or modify the root directory to search.
