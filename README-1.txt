Technical Requirements:

    Generation of Synthetic Data: Generate a set of synthetic data that includes varying levels of shadows and sun angles, using 3D models of objects that have varying levels of fidelity.

    Training of Computer Vision Model: Train a computer vision model on the synthetic data using TensorFlow or another open source machine learning library.

    Optimization of CV Network: Optimize the computer vision model by experimenting with different hyperparameters and optimizing the model's architecture.

    Evaluation of Results: Evaluate the performance of the CV model on a test set of real-world satellite imagery, using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.



Generating Advanced Synthetic Data:

For generating advanced synthetic data, we use a combination of 3D models. image fusion and synthetic dataset optimization techniques. The code is using Python v3.8 and the OpenCV library, and others listed in the developers notes:

Training and Optimizing the CV Model:

For training and optimizing the computer vision model, We use TensorFlow and another open-source machine learning library. The code using TensorFlow:

By combining these two codes, we can generate advanced synthetic data and train and optimize a computer vision model using TensorFlow or another open-source machine learning libraries.

There are many open-source machine learning libraries that can be used for training and optimizing computer vision models. TensorFlow and the following:

    PyTorch
    scikit-learn
    Keras
    Caffe
    MXNet
    Theano

Each library has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the developers specific requirements of the project.
